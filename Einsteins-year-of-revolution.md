## Miraculous Year
<details open>
<summary><b>English</b></summary>
The annus mirabilis (meaning 'miraculous year' in Latin) papers are four papers that Albert Einstein published in the scientific journal 'Annalen der Physik' (Annals of Physics) during the year 1905. These landmark publications contributed significantly to the foundation of modern physics. By these Einstein gained fame among physicists while working as a patent clerk at the Swiss patent office. These papers revolutionized physicists' understanding of the fundamental concepts in physics.[1]

## Photoelectric effect
The **first paper** on March, explained the _photoelectric effect_, which established the energy of the light quanta and the equation taught in Advance Level physics.
<!-- $$\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}$$ -->

   $$ E=hf $$

This was the discovery mentioned in the citation awarding Einstein the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics.

## Brownian motion
The **second paper** on May, explained Brownian motion and compelled physicists to accept the existence of atoms.

## Special theory of relativity
The **third paper** on June, introduced the special theory of relativity. Quote:

    "They suggest rather that, as has already been shown to the first order of small quantities, the same laws of electrodynamics and optics will be valid for all frames of reference for which the equations of mechanics hold good. We will raise this conjecture (the purport of which will hereafter be called the “Principle of Relativity”) to the status of a postulate, and also introduce another postulate, which is only apparently irreconcilable with the former, namely, that light is always propagated in empty space with a definite velocity c which is independent of the state of motion of the emitting body. These two postulates suffice for the attainment of a simple and consistent theory of the electrodynamics of moving bodies based on Maxwell’s theory for stationary bodies."

and derived the Lorentz transformations.
    
## Mass energy equivalence
The **fourth paper** on September, a consequence of special relativity, developed the principle of mass–energy equivalence, expressed in the equation:

$$ E = mc^2 $$
    
and which led to the discovery and use of nuclear power decades later.

If both postulates are true, distance $x$ and time $t$ must be relative to keep the speed of light $c = x/t$ constant for all observers.
